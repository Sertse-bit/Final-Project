About
-----
Provide a focused description of the project:
- Purpose and motivation.
- High-level architecture (web app, API, CLI, library, mobile, etc.).
- Who should use it and why.

Key Features
------------
- Feature 1 — short description
- Feature 2 — short description
- Feature 3 — short description
- (Add any non-obvious design decisions or trade-offs here)

Demo / Screenshots
------------------
(Optional) Add a screenshot or animated GIF showing the project in action.

Example:
![screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)

Tech Stack
----------
List the main languages, frameworks and tools used. Example:
- Languages: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, etc.
- Frameworks: React, Express, Django, Flask, Spring Boot, etc.
- Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.
- Dev tools: Docker, GitHub Actions, ESLint, Prettier, pytest, jest

(Replace the above with your actual stack.)

Getting Started
---------------
These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
-------------
Install the tools required for development and running the project. Example:
- Node.js >= 18 and npm or yarn
- Python >= 3.10 (if applicable)
- Docker (optional, recommended for consistent environment)
- Git

Installation
------------
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Sertse-bit/Final-Project.git
   cd Final-Project

2. Install dependencies (pick the appropriate command for your stack):
   - Node (npm):
     npm install
   - Node (yarn):
     yarn
   - Python (pip + venv):
     python -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration
-------------
Add environment variables and configuration files. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

Example `.env` (replace values with real ones):
```
# Example keys
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

Run Locally
-----------
General instructions for running the app in development mode.

- Node / JavaScript (example):
  npm run dev
  or
  yarn dev

- Python (Flask/Django example):
  flask run
  or
  python manage.py runserver

- Docker (recommended for parity):
  docker build -t final-project .
  docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env final-project

Replace the commands above with project-specific scripts from package.json, Makefile, or other tooling.

Testing
-------
Run tests locally:

- JavaScript (jest):
  npm test
  or
  yarn test

- Python (pytest):
  pytest

Include instructions for running unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, and how to run a specific test file.

Linting & Formatting
--------------------
Use linters and formatters to keep code consistent.

- JavaScript:
  npm run lint
  npm run format

- Python:
  flake8
  black .

Add pre-commit hooks (recommended) with Husky or pre-commit to enforce checks on commit.

Deployment
----------
Describe how to deploy the project.

- Deploy to a cloud provider (Heroku, AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean)
- CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions example):
  Provide a link to .github/workflows/ci.yml if present, or include a short example workflow.

Project Structure
-----------------
Provide a short explanation of the repository layout:

- /src or /app — application source code
- /docs — documentation and images
- /tests — unit and integration tests
- package.json / pyproject.toml — dependencies and scripts
- Dockerfile — container build instructions

Example:
```
Final-Project/
├─ src/
│  ├─ controllers/
│  ├─ services/
│  ├─ models/
│  └─ index.js
├─ tests/
├─ docs/
├─ Dockerfile
├─ package.json
└─ README.md
```

Contributing
------------
Thank you for considering contributing! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a topic branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature
3. Make changes and add tests.
4. Run tests and linter locally.
5. Open a pull request describing your changes.

Consider adding a CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed contribution and code review guidelines.

Acknowledgements
----------------
- List libraries, tutorials, and resources that helped build the project.
- Give credit to any collaborators or inspirations.

FAQ & Troubleshooting
---------------------
Q: I get "X error" when running the app.
A: Common cause: missing environment variable. Ensure `.env` exists and is populated.

Q: Tests failing locally but passing on CI.
A: Check your local environment vs CI environment (database migrations, seed data, versions).

Customizing this README
-----------------------
This README is intentionally template-like to make it easy to adapt. To make it the "best" README for this repository:
- Replace placeholder text and examples with specific commands, ports, and environment variable names used by your project.
- Add real screenshots and demo links.
- Add an "Architecture" or "Design" section if the project is large.
- Include badges for build/test coverage/CI when available.

If you want, I can:
- Generate a tailored README with commands and env vars if you tell me the project's language, frameworks, and dev commands.
- Add a GitHub Actions CI example for your tech stack.
- Create a CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, or a LICENSE file.

Thank you for sharing your final project — this README aims to be an excellent starting point to document and showcase it.
